# 👁️ eyeC(ybersecurity) — Beyond Defense, Absolute Visibility

> **Invisibility is not an option. We make the kernel transparent and the adversary predictable.**

---

## 🛡️ Our Vision: The Purple Team Paradigm
eyeC is a security engineering ecosystem focused on the power of **eBPF**. We believe that modern defense must not only block, but it must **observe, reason, and react** in real time at the heart of the Linux kernel.

### 🌪️ The Storm (Offensive) | [MAELSTROM-BREACH]
Our distributed adversary simulation framework.

- **Objective:** Stress large-scale security architectures.

- **Vectors:** SYN Pressure, L7 Method Abuse, DNS Tunneling.

- **Role:** Validate detection fidelity under massive background noise.

### 🛡️ The Shield (Defensive) | [SOVEREIGN-SHIELD]
Our self-healing and kernel defense architecture.

- **Technology:** Based on Cilium and Sentinel Trace.

- **Enforcement:** eBPF hooks for near-zero latency filtering.

- **Response:** Automated threat isolation via Ansible.

---

## 🧱 Our Technology Stack
- **Kernel & Hooks:** eBPF (XDP, TC, Kprobes)
- **Networking:** Cilium, Hubble, Envoy
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K3s), Ansible
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Sentinel Trace
- **Attack:** Kali Linux, Python (Scapy, Requests), hping3
